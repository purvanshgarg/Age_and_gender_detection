# Age_and_gender_detection

I implemented the code which was already available on the internet and made some tweaks so that I could run it on my machine.

You can refer the original code at:

https://projectgurukul.org/age-gender-detection-deep-learning/

All the dependencies have been taken care of, you just need to clone the repository and run the .ipynb file to run the model without any issue.
